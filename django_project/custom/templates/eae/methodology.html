            The Clean Cooking Explorer is an online, open-source, interactive platform that synthesizes and analyzes geographic datasets on both clean cooking supply and demand for Nepal.
            It is a multi-criteria analysis tool that uses location-specific resource availability and infrastructure data to represent the potential of different cooking fuels.
            It also incorporates demographic data and data on social uses to visualize cooking demand in different sectors.
            Together, these supply and demand indicators enable more comprehensive planning to achieve clean cooking for all of Nepal.
            Spatial analysis tools, including multi-criteria analysis, overlays, filters and buffer zones, help users identify and prioritize areas where clean cooking access can be expanded and should be prioritized.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tool incorporates remote sensing data as well as data from global, national, sub-national and census databases that are either publicly available or provided by partners and local stakeholders.
            It can host data available in various resolutions, scales and formats allowing for better or new datasets to be incorporated once available.
            The selection of data is based on a literature review and a survey WRI conducts on the importance of certain datasets in geospatial clean cooking planning.
